Howdy, I'm Edvinas Daneviƒçius - a Software Engineer who loves to waste time tinkering with all kinds of random things. I used work on JVM back-end applications and do some front-end web development from time to time. However, now I make interactive, real-time 3D applications and other cool looking things, such as virtual reality simulations and video games.

I like clean, structured and tested code. Static analysis and automation tools which help me to stay on this path are my best friends.

To get in touch, contact me via the email I have exposed on [GitHub].
